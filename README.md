# My Highschool Career
## Painting Sets for the Drama Club
As a sophomore, I became the Apprentice Painter for the EBHS Drama Club. Under the Head Painter, I helped direct the full painting of the set for Puffs and the Wizard of Oz. Although in Puffs I was mainly learning how to take on the role of Apprentice Painter, I had much more creative control over the Wizard of Oz and the a large portion of the set was painted under my direction or painted personally by me. I am a very creative & artistic person and becoming the Apprentice Painter was a really rewarding way to apply those skills and also learn leadership skills as I prepared to take on the role of Head Painter the following year.
