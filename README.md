# My Highschool Career
## Painting Sets for the Drama Club
As a sophomore, I became the Apprentice Painter for the EBHS Drama Club. Under the Head Painter, I helped direct the full painting of the set for Puffs and the Wizard of Oz. Although in Puffs I was mainly learning how to take on the role of Apprentice Painter, I had much more creative control over the Wizard of Oz and the a large portion of the set was painted under my direction or painted personally by me.
## Being Chosen For GHS Executive Board
Recently, I was inducted into German Honor Society and chosen to be the GHS Vice President for next year. I really enjoy being a part of GHS and I am excited to step into this role as a junior!
## Graphic Design
Throughout my freshman and sophomore years, I did graphic design both as a side business and for the drama club. I designed the poster and other advertising materials for the CJHS drama club's production of Alice in Wonderland: Down the Rabbit Hole. I also designed the bat mitzvah invitation and program for a family friend and the logo for  a few backyard rollercoaster projects (long story).
